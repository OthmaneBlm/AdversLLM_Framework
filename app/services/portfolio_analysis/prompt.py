Cloud and cybersecurity spending, especially in enterprise and government sectors, are expected to drive substantial growth.

4. Financial:
Financial services anticipate growth in digital assets, embedded finance, and wealth management innovations, particularly aimed at younger clients. The rise of digital wallets and the shift toward cashless systems are reshaping banking infrastructure. The sector is also preparing for regulatory updates regarding data privacy, cybersecurity, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. Additionally, higher interest rates may benefit banks' interest income, but they also pose challenges in credit quality and consumer loan demand.

5. Energy:
Energy markets will continue to adapt to energy transition mandates, balancing traditional oil and gas investments with substantial commitments to renewables. Renewables, driven by government incentives and corporate commitments, are expected to grow faster than traditional energy sources, especially in solar and wind. Meanwhile, oil and gas sectors will prioritize projects with lower carbon impacts. Energy security remains a concern, particularly in Europe, prompting investments in natural gas and other alternative fuels as buffer sources.

6. Industry:
Industrial sectors, including manufacturing and construction, will emphasize automation and digitalization in response to labor shortages and efficiency demands. Government investments in infrastructure, such as through the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., will bolster activity in sectors like construction, manufacturing, and engineering. Automation technologies, including robotics and AI, are anticipated to play key roles in improving productivity and resilience in industrial operations.

7. Telecommunications:
Telecommunications will focus on expanding 5G and fiber-optic infrastructure to meet growing data demands. Digital transformation within telcos is also prioritizing AI-driven customer service and network optimization. While competition intensifies, telecom providers are expected to diversify services to include bundled solutions such as security and cloud-based services. The push for net-zero operations has also led to green investments in energy-efficient infrastructure within the sector.

8. Real Estate:
Real estate will continue to adapt to changes in remote work, with commercial real estate exploring new uses for office spaces. Growth areas include industrial properties (for logistics and warehousing) and multi-family residentials. ESG considerations remain prominent, with increased demand for sustainable, energy-efficient properties.

Generate an executive summary report in markdown for a Private Banking client, presenting a friendly yet professional overview of the portfolio’s recent performance, suitability with client preferences, ESG alignment, and forward-looking market outlook. Tailor the report based on the client’s risk profile and ESG requirements. Try to write text in full sentences, instead of listing the information with bullet points.
There will be three sections. Write a small text per section summarizing the insights and conclusions supported by numerical data. At the end of the report, show the quantitative data for the client's portfolio.
I have the following information about the client and his/her portfolio: 
{client_info} {client_portfolio}
Use {portfolio_code} to reference the portfolio.

Start the executive summary with ‘Dear Mr. {client_name},’ and follow these sections:

1. Portfolio Performance Overview:
In this section, write easily readible text giving an overview of the portfolio's performance.
I have the following data on the client's portfolio: 
{taxonomy_info} {sfdr_info} {performance_info}
1.1 Review asset-level suitability for each category (taxonomy, SFDR, performance) with specific_suitability_scores. Explain if they align or misalign with the client’s risk and ESG preferences.
1.2 Compare portfolio performance to the client’s MiFID Risk Profile ({client_risk_profile}), noting any significant deviations.
I have the following data on the client's portfolio: 
{sector_info} {geograph_info} {asset_info}
I have the following info on the past performance of the market:

I have the following data: {full_data_string}. Analyze the provided portfolio comparison and generate a detailed narrative report in markdown. Highlight only the significant changes (those with a delta greater than 5%), focusing on the following aspects:

1. **Portfolio Adjustment Summary**:
   - Summarize the most notable changes in the portfolio, focusing on adjustments to product weights, geographical focus, sector allocations, and asset classes when the changes exceed a 5% threshold.
   - Underline the specific products driving these changes and describe their influence on the portfolio’s composition and strategy.

2. **Suitability and Alignment Comparison**:
   - Evaluate the portfolio’s alignment with the client’s MiFID risk profile ({client_risk_profile}) and describe whether the adjustments bring it closer to the recommended ranges for equity and bond allocations. Avoid mentioning thresholds explicitly; instead, indicate alignment qualitatively (e.g., “aligned,” “better aligned,” or “misaligned”).
   - Discuss ESG alignment by focusing on:
     - Significant changes in taxonomy suitability, Safir suitability, SFDR suitability, and Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs) that exceed the 5% threshold.
     - Highlight specific products responsible for these changes and explain their role in the portfolio’s ESG impact.
   - Provide a market-aligned assessment of the portfolio adjustments, emphasizing whether the changes align well with the current market trends and forecasted conditions ({market_outlook}). Discuss whether the diversification or sectoral adjustments are beneficial based on this outlook.

3. **Key Benefits and Drawbacks of the Arbitrage**:
   - Narrate the benefits introduced by the portfolio adjustments, emphasizing products that significantly enhance diversification, ESG compliance, or alignment with the client’s objectives.
   - Clearly outline the drawbacks, focusing on products or changes that may introduce risks, reduce ESG compliance, or conflict with the client’s investment preferences.

4. **Full Portfolio Comparison**:
   - Describe how the simulated portfolio compares to the current one in terms of geographical and sector diversification, ESG alignment, and overall strategy. Focus only on significant changes (above 5%) and avoid explicit mention of financial performance metrics.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendation**:
   - Provide a concise summary of the simulated portfolio’s strengths and weaknesses, focusing on qualitative improvements or concerns.
   - Offer a balanced recommendation on whether to adopt the simulated portfolio, including suggestions for mitigating any identified risks or drawbacks.
   - Conclude with a professional suggestion to discuss these findings with the client’s portfolio manager for final advice.

Generate the analysis as a cohesive story, avoiding bullet points and lists. Use small, engaging paragraphs for each section, ensuring clarity and narrative flow. Underline the products responsible for significant changes in the portfolio to make them stand out within the report.
